# <div class="story-box font-body">
# <p>
# Hello everyone 👋, I am <strong>Chef Transformer</strong>,
# the owner of this restaurant. I was made by a group of <a href="https://huggingface.co/flax-community/t5-recipe-generation#team-members">NLP Engineers</a> to train my two prodigy recipe creators: <strong>Chef Scheherazade</strong> and <strong>Chef Giovanni</strong>.
# Both of my students participated in my rigorous culinary program, <a href="https://huggingface.co/flax-community/t5-recipe-generation">T5 fine-tuning</a>,
# to learn how to prepare exquisite cuisines from a wide variety of ingredients.
# I've never been more proud of my students -- both can produce exceptional dishes but I regard Scheherazade as being <em>creative</em> while Giovanni is <em>meticulous</em>.
# If you give each of them the same ingredients, they'll usually come up with something different. <br /><br />
# At the start of the program the chefs read cookbooks containing thousands of recipes of varying difficulties and from cultures all over the world.
# The NLP engineers helped guide the learning process so that the chefs could actually learn which ingredients work well together rather than just memorize recipes.
# I trained my chefs by asking them to generate a title, a list of ingredients (including amounts!), and a list of directions after giving them just a simple list of food items.
# </p>
# <pre>[Inputs]
#     {food items*: separated by comma}

# [Targets]
#     title: {TITLE} &lt;section>
#     ingredients: {INGREDIENTS: separated by &lt;sep>} &lt;section>
#     directions: {DIRECTIONS: separated by &lt;sep>}.
# </pre>
# <p>
#   <em>In the cookbooks (a.k.a <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/recipe_nlg">dataset</a>), the food items were referred to as NER. </em>
# </p>
# <p>
# In the span of a week, my chefs went from spitting out nonsense to creating masterpieces.
# Their learning rate was exceptionally high and each batch of recipes was better than the last. <br />
# In their final exam, they achieved <a href="https://huggingface.co/flax-community/t5-recipe-generation#evaluation">high scores</a> 💯 in a
# standardized industry test and established this restaurant 🍲. Please tell your friends and family about us!
# We create each recipe with a smile on our faces 🤗 Everyone at the restaurant is grateful for the generous support of
# HuggingFace and Google for hosting Flax Community week.
